# SmartDataLoader (WIP)

ðŸš€ __SmartDataLoader__ is your intelligent assistant for loading datasets seamlessly! Designed for data practitioners, it simplifies handling messy imports and automates importing processes. From diagnosing common issues to providing practical solutions, SmartDataLoader ensures you spend less time loading data and more time analyzing.

ðŸš€ __SmartDataLoader__ is your intelligent, cutting-edge assistant for effortlessly loading datasets and solving import issues! Built for data practitioners, it goes beyond simple automation by __integrating a powerful LLM-based API RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) to help you troubleshoot and resolve data import errors in real time__. Whether you're dealing with formatting challenges or missing metadata, SmartDataLoader will guide you through the process and offer practical solutions, reducing manual effort and speeding up imports.

__Quick imports, intelligent fixes, and interactive supportâ€”SmartDataLoader makes dataset loading faster and smarter than ever.__
